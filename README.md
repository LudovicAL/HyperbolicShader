# HyperbolicShader
This shader demonstrates a hyperbolic-like effect. The further away from an object the observer is, the the more stretched the object representation gets. The shader's effect can be adjusted so that the observer is made capable of seeing all sides of a cube at once (at the cost of making orientation and navigation in the environment virtually impossible).

An online version of the "game" can be accessed at https://ludovical.github.io/HyperbolicShader/
(note that the page could take a few minutes to load the WebGL player in the background).
